#For my app the idea is an app that helps you manage your money and always know the exact amount of money that you have in 
order to reach certain goal. You enter the goal that you want to reach and then you enter the amount of money that you spend.
Everytime you spend more money you add it into your expenses and everytime you earn or gain more money you add it to your income.
In the end when you are done it will tell you if you met your goal and how much you exceeded it by or how much you missed
it by.
